CODE AND TEST COMPLETION
------------------------
1. HTTP proxy to implement for better debugging of outgoing messages
   Fix 502 error with HTTP test 7 - no AT cookie found - needs logging
   Assert JSON result in test number 7
   Forward custom headers from the client and verify they are sent

2. Add better OPTIONS tests from token handler api
   Ensure that access-control-request-headers is handled correctly
   Take care to only test reverse proxy responsibilities

3. Deal with routing to the OAuth Agent
   This will require forwarding cookies and returning them in responses
   Update npm run setup to call https://api.authsamples.com/oauth-agent

LOCAL INTEGRATION
-----------------
1. Reduce and deploy a new oauth-agent API on a feature branch of tokenhandlerapi
   Update tests to represent traffic from the reverse proxy to the OAuth Agent
   A custom packager may be needed to deploy the correct config
   They must no longer deal with CORS but to still do CSRF and cookie handling
   Also update README naming, ready for merging

2. Serverless API feature branch that no longer deal with cookies, CORS or CSRF
   Update tests to represent traffic from the reverse proxy to the API
   They must only use access tokens, as for a mobile client, and 'npm run setup' will change
   Build a package and a custom packager may be needed to get the right config
   Do not deploy, since it will break the deployed system

3. SPA repointed on a branch and working on my local PC
   Do not deploy, since it will break the deployed system

CLOUD INTEGRATION
-----------------
1. Request a new AWS cert that includes tokenhandler domain
   Then see if I can swap certs for existing resources

2. Run 'npm run package && npm run deploy' for reverse proxy to https://tokenhandler.authsamples.com
   Ensure the correct configuration
   
3. Deploy oauth-agent, serverless-api and spa
   Delete tokenhandlerapi

4. Elasticsearch logs for reverse proxy errors

KUBERNETES INTEGRATION
----------------------
1. Will mostly work, but oauth-agent will no longer have CORS support
   I may need to use the Kong cors plugin:
   https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/cors

OTHER
-----
1. Codacy support for OAuth Agent and Reverse Proxy

1. My requirements are to route and also run a lambda, whereas AWS Proxy Integration does not support this
