CODE COMPLETION
---------------
0. errors and compilation
   move Container to plumbing/utilities
   move logEntry to container
   get tests passing and check in

1. Basic API routing to finish
   Get 'npm run setup' done

2. Add tests
   Draw the lines between end-to-end and too much detail for other components
   This should only verify the reverse proxy responsibilities

3. Forward custom headers from the client

4. Deal with routing to the OAuth Agent
   This will require forwarding cookies and returning them in responses

SPA INTEGRATION
---------------
1. Reduce and deploy a new oauth-agent API on a feature branch of tokenhandlerapi
   Also update README naming, ready for merging

2. Serverless API must no longer deal with cookies, CORS or CSRF
   Update tests to only receive tokens

3. Token handler must no longer deal with CORS
   Update tests to only receive tokens

4. SPA repointed on a branch and working on my local PC

API INTEGRATION
---------------
1. No local Docker by default - get it working and see what performance is like
   Then update deploy.sh with support for a local token handler
   deploy.sh will need to update local config files

1. Include tokenhandlerapi and reverseproxy as codacy projects
   Also document use of console.error for local debugging, to avoid writing to response files

DEPLOYED ENVIRONMENT UPDATES
----------------------------
1. Reverse proxy for deployed SPA
   Request a new AWS cert that includes tokenhandler domain, then swap certs for existing resources
   Include Elasticsearch logs for errors, then do curl requests to verify
   Custom packager may be needed
