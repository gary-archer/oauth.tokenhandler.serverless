INITIAL CODE
------------
1. Log Consolidation in other projects
   Update Serverless API logging to use proper event object
   Do the same IS_LOCAL based logging everywhere and avoid 'mode=development'
   Leftover code in serverless API to log when event.type === 'REQUEST', in LogEntryImpl.calculateOperationName

CODE COMPLETION
---------------
1. Get cookie and CSRF code ported from the OLD folder and working
   Headers will be tricky and should be done according to convention, to avoid sending bad protocol headers
   Get 'npm run setup' done

2. Many error codes to handle, from the OLD folder

SPA INTEGRATION
---------------
1. Reduce and deploy a new oauth-agent API on a feature branch of tokenhandlerapi
   Also update README naming, ready for merging

2. Serverless API must no longer deal with cookies, CORS or CSRF

3. Token handler must no longer deal with CORS

4. SPA repointed on a branch and working on my local PC

API INTEGRATION
---------------
1. No local Docker by default - get it working and see what performance is like
   Then update deploy.sh with support for a local token handler
   deploy.sh will need to update local config files

1. Include tokenhandlerapi and reverseproxy as codacy projects
   Also document use of console.error for local debugging, to avoid writing to response files

DEPLOYED ENVIRONMENT UPDATES
----------------------------
1. Reverse proxy for deployed SPA
   Request a new AWS cert that includes tokenhandler domain, then swap certs for existing resources
   Include Elasticsearch logs for errors, then do curl requests to verify
   Custom packager may be needed
