IMPL
----
1. Do full logging for OAuth Agent requests, including milliseconds taken

2. Fix up proxying of request headers
   Add a 500 error response test

3. ResponseWriter.objectResponse changes to Serverless API, to prevent cryptic 502 response errors
   Check for typeof object

LOCAL API
---------
1. Local token handler repo branch to merge with local token handler deployment
   Call it oauth.tokenhandler.kubernetes
   Get rid of caching of config and aim to update to express.static

2. Ensure that cloud native deployment repo still works

3. Merge and deploy all, deleting TODO files and backing up notes

4. Codacy updates for changed repos

5. Elasticsearch logs - all OAuth Agent requests and only internal errors for OAuth Proxy

DOC
-------------
1. My requirements are to route and also run a lambda, whereas AWS Proxy Integration does not support this
