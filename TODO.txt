FIRST STEPS
-----------
1. Update dependencies and get code running with a minimal mock implementation

2. Verify catch all path by deploying to the new dev domain:

3. Get a basic router working and calling Serverless API
   Run locally, and route to target API
   Invalid paths should not reach target endpoints

4. Get deployment planned, with versions on both the deployed and local environments
   How to express that?

5. Get cookie translation code working, followed by axios call to Serverless API
   For tokenhandler path it should instead be a straight pass through - manage this via config

6. Get SPA working on a feature branch
